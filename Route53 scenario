Here are some scenario-based AWS Route 53 interview questions along with their answers:


---

1. Scenario: A company wants to route traffic to its application in the nearest AWS region for better performance. How can they achieve this?

Answer:

Use Latency-based Routing in Route 53.

Create records for each AWS region where the application is deployed.

Route 53 will automatically direct users to the closest region with the lowest latency.



---

2. Scenario: Your website is hosted on an EC2 instance, and users report intermittent downtime. How would you troubleshoot using Route 53?

Answer:

1. Check Route 53 health checks – Ensure the EC2 instance has an associated health check.


2. Verify DNS records – Ensure the domain points to the correct public IP or load balancer.


3. Check EC2 instance status – Verify that the instance is running and reachable.


4. Analyze CloudWatch logs – Identify potential failures.


5. Test connectivity – Use nslookup or dig commands to check DNS resolution.

3. Scenario: A global e-commerce website wants to serve different versions of the website based on users’ countries. How can this be implemented?

Answer:

Use Geolocation Routing in Route 53.

Create separate DNS records for each country (e.g., US, India, UK).

Route 53 will direct users to the appropriate version based on their geographic location.



---

4. Scenario: Your primary website is down, and you want traffic to be automatically redirected to a backup site. How would you achieve this?

Answer:

Use Failover Routing in Route 53.

Configure two records:

Primary record (Active) → Points to the main website.

Secondary record (Passive) → Points to the backup site.


Set up Route 53 health checks to monitor the primary site.

If the primary fails, Route 53 automatically redirects traffic to the backup.

5. Scenario: A customer has multiple AWS accounts and wants to resolve internal domain names across VPCs. How can they achieve this?

Answer:

Use Route 53 Private Hosted Zones (PHZ) to create internal DNS records.

Enable VPC Peering or AWS Transit Gateway for cross-VPC communication.

Use Route 53 Resolver Rules to forward DNS queries between VPCs.



---

6. Scenario: Your team deployed a static website on an S3 bucket, but the domain is not resolving correctly. What steps would you take?

Answer:

1. Verify S3 bucket name – It must match the exact domain name (e.g., example.com).


2. Enable static website hosting on S3.


3. Check Route 53 records – Ensure an Alias record points to the S3 website endpoint.


4. Verify DNS propagation – Use nslookup or dig to check if the domain is resolving.


5. Check S3 permissions – The bucket must have public read access or a CloudFront distribution.




---

7. Scenario: A company wants to perform a canary deployment by directing 90% of users to the old version and 10% to the new version. How can they do this?

Answer:

Use Weighted Routing in Route 53.

Create two DNS records:

Old version → 90% weight

New version → 10% weight


Route 53 will distribute traffic accordingly.



---

8. Scenario: A customer wants to migrate their existing domain from GoDaddy to Route 53. What are the key steps?

Answer:

1. Check if the domain transfer is supported in Route 53.


2. Unlock the domain in GoDaddy.


3. Request an authorization code from GoDaddy.


4. Initiate the transfer in Route 53 and enter the code.


5. Approve the transfer email sent by AWS.


6. Update name servers in Route 53 (if needed).


7. Wait for propagation (may take 24-48 hours).




---

9. Scenario: You need to ensure your API Gateway remains accessible even if a specific AWS region goes down. How can Route 53 help?

Answer:

Deploy the API Gateway in multiple AWS regions.

Use Latency-based Routing to direct users to the closest API.

Configure Failover Routing in case one region goes down.

Set up health checks to detect failures and reroute traffic.



---

10. Scenario: You need to set up a subdomain (api.example.com) that resolves to a CloudFront distribution. How would you do it?

Answer:

1. Create a CloudFront distribution and note the DNS name (xyz.cloudfront.net).


2. Go to Route 53 and open the hosted zone for example.com.


3. Create a CNAME or Alias record for api.example.com pointing to CloudFront.


4. Ensure SSL/TLS is configured with an ACM certificate for api.example.com.


5. Test DNS resolution using nslookup api.example.com.




---

11. Scenario: A company's application is deployed on-premises and in AWS. They want AWS-hosted users to resolve on-premises DNS queries. What’s the best solution?

Answer:

Use Route 53 Resolver with Outbound Endpoints.

Create Forwarding Rules to send DNS queries for on-prem domains to the on-premises DNS servers.

Ensure VPC DNS resolution is enabled.



---

12. Scenario: Your website’s DNS updates are taking too long to propagate. What could be the reason?

Answer:

1. High TTL value – Lower the TTL to propagate changes faster.


2. DNS caching – Flush local and ISP caches (ipconfig /flushdns).


3. Registrar delay – Ensure the domain registrar has updated name servers.


4. Propagation time – Global updates may take up to 24 hours.




---

13. Scenario: A business wants users from the US to be routed to an application running on AWS while users from Europe should be routed to their on-prem data center. How can they configure this?

Answer:

Use Geolocation Routing in Route 53.

Create a record for the US pointing to the AWS application.

Create a record for Europe pointing to the on-prem data center.



---

14. Scenario: How would you monitor and log DNS queries in Route 53?

Answer:

Enable Route 53 Query Logging.

Send logs to CloudWatch Logs, S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose for analysis.

Use Athena or CloudTrail to analyze query trends.



---

15. Scenario: A company has multiple subdomains like app.example.com, blog.example.com, and shop.example.com. They want a centralized way to manage them. What’s the best approach?

Answer:

Use a single Hosted Zone for example.com in Route 53.

Create A, CNAME, or Alias records for each subdomain (app, blog, shop).

Optionally, create a wildcard record (*.example.com) for dynamic subdomain handling.

These scenario-based Route 53 interview questions will help you prepare for real-world use cases. Do you want more hands-on practical exercises as well?
