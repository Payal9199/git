Here are some commonly asked AWS Route 53 interview questions along with their answers:


---

1. What is AWS Route 53?

Answer:
AWS Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service that helps route traffic to AWS resources and external websites. It supports domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.


---

2. What are the main features of Route 53?

Answer:

Domain Registration – Buy and manage domain names.

DNS Routing – Map domain names to AWS resources like EC2, S3, and CloudFront.

Traffic Flow – Route traffic intelligently based on latency, geolocation, and other factors.

Health Checks & Failover – Monitor endpoints and automatically route traffic to healthy ones.

Private DNS – Manage internal DNS within a VPC.



---

3. What are the routing policies available in Route 53?

Answer:

1. Simple Routing – Routes traffic to a single resource (no failover).


2. Weighted Routing – Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on assigned weights.


3. Latency-based Routing – Routes users to the AWS region with the lowest latency.


4. Geolocation Routing – Routes users based on their geographic location.


5. Geoproximity Routing – Routes traffic based on a bias that increases/decreases traffic to a region.


6. Failover Routing – Routes traffic to a primary resource and fails over to a secondary resource if the primary is unhealthy.


7. Multivalue Answer Routing – Returns multiple healthy IPs for load balancing.

4. What is the difference between a Public Hosted Zone and a Private Hosted Zone?


---

5. How does Route 53 handle failover?

Answer:

Route 53 uses health checks to monitor endpoint availability.

In Failover Routing, if the primary endpoint fails, traffic is redirected to the secondary endpoint automatically.

Health checks can monitor HTTP, TCP, or HTTPS response codes.



---

6. What is an Alias Record in Route 53? How is it different from a CNAME?

Answer:

Alias Record:

Works at the root domain level (e.g., example.com).

Maps directly to AWS resources (e.g., S3, CloudFront, ALB, ELB).

Free of cost in Route 53.


CNAME Record:

Can only be used on subdomains (e.g., www.example.com).

Maps to another domain name but cannot point to AWS resources directly.

Standard DNS resolution applies (may incur additional costs).

7. How do you set up a custom domain for an S3 static website using Route 53?

Answer:

1. Create an S3 bucket and enable "Static website hosting."


2. Copy the S3 endpoint URL.


3. Go to Route 53 → Create a hosted zone for your domain.


4. Add an Alias Record pointing the domain to the S3 bucket.


5. Update your domain's name servers (if needed).


6. Test the setup by accessing the domain in a browser.




---

8. What is the TTL (Time to Live) in Route 53?

Answer:

TTL (Time to Live) is the duration (in seconds) that DNS resolvers cache a record before requesting an update from Route 53.

Lower TTL values (e.g., 60 seconds) allow quicker updates but increase DNS query costs.

Higher TTL values (e.g., 86400 seconds or 24 hours) reduce costs but delay updates.



---

9. How does Route 53 support hybrid cloud DNS resolution?

Answer:

Route 53 can integrate with AWS Direct Connect and VPNs for hybrid cloud setups.

Private Hosted Zones enable internal name resolution within AWS VPCs.

Route 53 Resolver allows forwarding DNS queries between on-premises and AWS.



---

10. How can Route 53 be used for disaster recovery?

Answer:
Route 53 supports disaster recovery using:

Failover Routing – Automatically redirects traffic to backup resources if the primary fails.

Weighted Routing – Diverts a portion of traffic to a backup region before a full failover.

Latency-based Routing – Routes traffic to the closest healthy region to minimize downtime.



---

11. What is the difference between Route 53 and a traditional DNS provider?


---

12. Can you create a subdomain in Route 53? How?

Answer:
Yes, you can create a subdomain by:

1. Creating a record set in Route 53 for the subdomain (e.g., blog.example.com).


2. Adding an A record, CNAME, or Alias pointing to the appropriate target.


3. If managing subdomains separately, create a new hosted zone for the subdomain and delegate NS records in the parent domain.




---

13. What are Route 53 Health Checks?

Answer:

Route 53 monitors endpoint health using HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP checks.

If an endpoint fails, Route 53 automatically routes traffic to a backup resource (failover).

You can configure CloudWatch Alarms for failed health checks.



---

14. How do you migrate a domain to Route 53?

Answer:

1. Check domain eligibility in Route 53.


2. Unlock the domain with the current registrar.


3. Get the transfer authorization code from the existing provider.


4. Initiate domain transfer in Route 53 and enter the code.


5. Approve the transfer via email confirmation.


6. Update the name servers to Route 53 if needed.




---

15. What is Route 53 Resolver?

Answer:

Route 53 Resolver is an AWS-managed service for DNS resolution between on-premises data centers and AWS VPCs.

It enables DNS forwarding and hybrid cloud integration.

Works with AWS Direct Connect and VPNs.
