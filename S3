Hereâ€™s a curated list of Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) interview questions along with their answers to help you prepare:

Basic Questions

1. What is Amazon RDS?
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a fully managed database service provided by AWS that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

2. What are the benefits of using Amazon RDS?

Automated backups

High availability with Multi-AZ deployments

Read scalability with Read Replicas

Security through VPC, IAM, and encryption (at rest and in transit)

Easy scaling (vertically and horizontally)


3. Which databases are supported by RDS?

MySQL

PostgreSQL

MariaDB

Oracle Database

SQL Server

Amazon Aurora (MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible)


4. How does RDS differ from Amazon EC2-hosted databases?
RDS is a managed service that automates tasks like backups, updates, and scaling, while EC2-hosted databases require full administrative control and manual management.

Intermediate Questions

5. What is Multi-AZ in RDS?
Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) ensures high availability by creating a standby replica in a different Availability Zone. Failover occurs automatically in case of primary database failure.

6. What are Read Replicas?
Read Replicas are used to improve read performance by allowing read-heavy workloads to be distributed across multiple database instances. They are asynchronous and can be promoted to standalone databases if needed.

7. How does RDS handle backups?
RDS provides two types of backups:

Automated Backups: Automatically taken daily and retained for a user-defined retention period (up to 35 days).

Manual Snapshots: User-initiated backups that persist until explicitly deleted.


8. Can RDS instances be encrypted?
Yes, RDS supports encryption at rest using AWS KMS (Key Management Service). Encryption is enabled during instance creation and applies to data, backups, snapshots, and replicas.

9. How do you scale an RDS instance?

Vertical Scaling: Change the instance size (e.g., from t3.medium to m5.large).

Horizontal Scaling: Use Read Replicas for scaling read operations.


10. How does Amazon Aurora differ from other RDS engines?
Amazon Aurora is a high-performance database engine developed by AWS that is MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible. It offers:

5x performance improvement over standard MySQL

3x improvement over PostgreSQL

Storage auto-scaling up to 128 TB

Built-in fault tolerance and high availability

Advanced Questions

11. How does RDS ensure database security?

Network Isolation: Using VPC to isolate database instances.

Access Control: Using IAM for user and role-based access.

Encryption: At rest with KMS and in transit with SSL/TLS.

Monitoring: Through CloudWatch and auditing with CloudTrail.


12. What happens during RDS failover in a Multi-AZ setup?
During failover, the standby replica becomes the primary database. AWS updates the DNS endpoint, so the application can connect to the new primary without changes.

13. How do you monitor an RDS instance?

CloudWatch Metrics: For CPU utilization, memory, IOPS, etc.

Enhanced Monitoring: Provides OS-level metrics.

Performance Insights: Identifies performance bottlenecks.

Logs: Review logs for slow queries, errors, etc.


14. What are RDS reserved instances?
Reserved instances allow you to save costs by committing to a database instance for a one- or three-year term. They offer significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing.

15. How can you migrate an on-premises database to RDS?
Migration can be done using:

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS): Automates schema and data migration.

Manual Backup and Restore: Dump the database, upload to S3, and import into RDS.

Scenario-Based Questions

16. Your RDS instance is running out of storage. What steps will you take?

Modify the storage type or size in the RDS console.

Enable "storage auto-scaling" to automatically increase storage as needed.


17. How would you troubleshoot high CPU utilization on an RDS instance?

Check queries using Performance Insights or slow query logs.

Optimize indexes and queries.

Scale up the instance (e.g., increase vCPU).

Evaluate application workload.


18. Can you connect to an RDS instance from outside AWS?
Yes, but ensure the RDS instance is in a public subnet with appropriate security group rules (allow inbound traffic on the database port) and an Elastic IP or public DNS.
