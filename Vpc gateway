Here are some interview questions and answers related to AWS Transit Gateway, Flow Logs, and VPC Endpoints:


---

Transit Gateway

1. What is AWS Transit Gateway?

Answer: AWS Transit Gateway is a network transit hub that allows you to connect multiple VPCs, on-premises data centers, and AWS Direct Connect or VPN connections through a centralized routing mechanism instead of peering each VPC separately.

2. How does Transit Gateway differ from VPC peering?

Answer:
| Feature | Transit Gateway | VPC Peering | |---------|----------------|-------------| | Scalability | Connects thousands of VPCs | Limited to a few VPCs | | Routing Complexity | Centralized routing via TGW | Full mesh complexity | | Multicast Support | Yes | No | | Inter-region Support | Yes | Yes (limited) | | Bandwidth | Uses AWS backbone | Peer-to-peer |

3. How does AWS Transit Gateway handle route propagation?

Answer: Transit Gateway uses route tables to manage how traffic flows between attached VPCs and on-premises networks. It supports static and dynamic (BGP-based) route propagation.

4. What are Transit Gateway Attachments?

Answer: Attachments define connections to the Transit Gateway. These include:

VPC attachments (for connecting VPCs)

VPN attachments (for site-to-site VPN)

Direct Connect attachments (for on-premise AWS connectivity)

Peering attachments (for inter-region TGW connections)


5. Can you apply Security Groups to a Transit Gateway?

Answer: No, Security Groups are VPC-specific. However, you can use Network ACLs and AWS Network Firewall for security.

VPC Flow Logs

6. What are VPC Flow Logs?

Answer: VPC Flow Logs capture IP traffic metadata flowing through your VPC's network interfaces (ENIs) for security monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance.

7. Where can VPC Flow Logs be stored?

Answer: They can be sent to:

Amazon CloudWatch Logs

Amazon S3

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose


8. What are the different flow log record types?

Answer:

Accepted traffic: Allowed network flows

Rejected traffic: Blocked network flows

All traffic: Both accepted and rejected


9. Can you enable VPC Flow Logs on Transit Gateway?

Answer: Yes, Transit Gateway supports flow logs, which provide visibility into traffic between connected networks.

10. What are some common use cases for VPC Flow Logs?

Answer:

Security analysis (Detect suspicious activity)

Troubleshooting connectivity issues

Compliance and auditing

VPC Endpoints

11. What are VPC Endpoints?

Answer: VPC Endpoints enable private connectivity between a VPC and AWS services without using the internet, NAT Gateway, or VPN.

12. What are the types of VPC Endpoints?

Answer:

Interface Endpoint: Uses ENI to connect to AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch privately.

Gateway Endpoint: Specifically for S3 and DynamoDB.

Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint (GWLB Endpoint): Routes traffic to a GWLB for inspection.


13. What are the benefits of using VPC Endpoints?

Answer:

Improved Security (No exposure to public internet)

Reduced Latency (Direct AWS backbone traffic)

Cost Savings (Avoids NAT Gateway charges)


14. How do Interface Endpoints differ from Gateway Endpoints?

Answer:
| Feature | Interface Endpoint | Gateway Endpoint | |---------|------------------|----------------| | Uses ENI? | Yes | No | | Supported Services | Most AWS services | Only S3 & DynamoDB | | Private IP | Yes | No | | Requires Route Table Update? | No | Yes |

15. Can you apply Security Groups to a VPC Endpoint?

Answer:

Yes, for Interface Endpoints (since they use ENIs)

No, for Gateway Endpoints (since they are route-based)
