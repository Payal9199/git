Here are some common AWS interview questions on Amazon SES, SNS, and CloudWatch Alarms, along with their answers:

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)

1. What is Amazon SES?
Answer: Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a cloud-based email-sending service that allows businesses to send marketing, transactional, and notification emails at scale. It supports SMTP and API-based sending.


2. What are the key use cases of Amazon SES?
Answer:

Sending transactional emails (e.g., order confirmations, password resets).

Marketing emails (newsletters, promotions).

Notifications (alerts, system updates).



3. How does SES handle email deliverability and reputation management?
Answer: SES includes features like:

Dedicated IPs for better reputation control.

DKIM and SPF to authenticate emails.

Suppression list to prevent sending to bounced or complaint-raising addresses.

Bounce and complaint monitoring via SNS notifications.



4. What is a sending quota in SES?
Answer: The sending quota defines the maximum number of emails that can be sent per day and per second. AWS increases quotas based on reputation and request.


5. How can you monitor email sending status in SES?
Answer: By integrating SES with CloudWatch, SNS, or event publishing, you can track email bounces, complaints, and delivery metrics.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

6. What is Amazon SNS?
Answer: Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables message distribution to multiple subscribers, including email, SMS, Lambda, and SQS.


7. How does SNS work?
Answer: SNS operates on a publisher-subscriber model, where publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages through different protocols (HTTP/S, email, SMS, Lambda, or SQS).


8. What are some common use cases for SNS?
Answer:

Sending notifications (e.g., system alerts, monitoring events).

Broadcasting messages to multiple recipients.

Decoupling microservices in event-driven architectures.



9. What is the difference between SNS and SQS?
Answer:

SNS (Push-based): Messages are pushed to multiple subscribers.

SQS (Pull-based): Messages are stored in a queue until consumers poll and retrieve them.

SNS is used for event notifications, while SQS is better for decoupling services.



10. How can SNS be secured?
Answer: By using:



Access policies to restrict who can publish/subscribe.

Encryption (KMS) for message security.

VPC Endpoints for private communication.

Amazon CloudWatch Alarms

11. What is Amazon CloudWatch?
Answer: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides metrics, logs, and alarms for AWS resources and applications.


12. What are CloudWatch Alarms?
Answer: CloudWatch Alarms monitor specific AWS metrics and trigger actions when predefined thresholds are exceeded.


13. How do you create a CloudWatch Alarm?
Answer:



Choose a metric (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage).

Set a threshold condition (e.g., CPU > 80%).

Define an action (e.g., send SNS notification, trigger an Auto Scaling action).

Attach the alarm to a resource.


14. What are the possible states of a CloudWatch Alarm?
Answer:



OK: The metric is within the normal threshold.

ALARM: The metric has breached the threshold.

INSUFFICIENT_DATA: Not enough data to determine the state.


15. What are some use cases for CloudWatch Alarms?
Answer:



Monitoring EC2 instance performance.

Automatically scaling instances based on traffic.

Sending alerts for high latency, errors, or application failures.


16. Can CloudWatch Alarms trigger Auto Scaling?
Answer: Yes, alarms can trigger Auto Scaling policies to launch or terminate instances based on metrics like CPU utilization.


17. How can you reduce unnecessary alarm notifications?
Answer: By using:



Anomaly detection to avoid false positives.

Multiple evaluation periods before triggering an alarm.

Metric math to combine multiple conditions.
